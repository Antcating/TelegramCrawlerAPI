### Prerequisites

Project is built using PostgresQL and FastAPI. There is a Docker container for both of them, so you don't have to setup everything yourself. The only thing, that is needed is [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) running locally on your machine or install Docker Engine and docker-compose individually.

Clone this project:

```
git clone https://github.com/Antcating/TelegramCrawlerAPI.git
```
Go to the project directory:

```
cd TelegramCrawlerAPI
```
And run docker-compose to start up the project:
```
docker-compose up
```

## ‚≠ê Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The container will start with API running locally on `0.0.0.0:8000`. 

You can check it using by going to `0.0.0.0:8000` in your browser. It has to return JSON with Ok row set to true. All possible API calls with descriptions could be seen on the `0.0.0.0:8000/docs`. You can try manually adding new channels or connections and see the response from database.
